# The first half of the 6.5 merge window

By **Jonathan Corbet**  
June 30, 2023

The first days of the 6.5 merge window have been a bit calmer than usual, with "only" 4,000 non-merge changesets having been pulled into the mainline repository. Those changesets include a fair amount of significant work, though. Read on for LWN's summary of the first set of changes merged for the next major kernel release.  

#### Architecture-specific

- X86 systems can now parallelize much of the process of bringing up all of the CPUs, reducing the time to get all processors online by as much as a factor of ten.
- X86启动时间减少了数十倍
- Intel's "Topology Aware Register and PM Capsule Interface" (abbreviated "TPMI") is now supported. This is an interface that provides a better way of managing power-management features.
- 英特尔的TPMI功耗寄存器支持了
- The [arm64 permission-indirection extension](https://lwn.net/Articles/925757/) is now supported. There is no new functionality resulting from this support now, but it is needed for some upcoming features.
- arm64支持间接权限扩展，一些即将推出的特性需要它

#### Core kernel

- The io_uring subsystem has gained the ability to store the rings and submission queue in user-space memory, rather than having the kernel allocate that memory. This allows user space to allocate the needed memory as huge pages, hopefully improving performance. [This changelog](https://git.kernel.org/linus/03d89a2de25b) has a little more information.
- The kernel's Rust support has been upgraded to the Rust 1.68.2 release, the first such upgrade since that support was merged. Other than that, the changes to Rust support were relatively minor this time around; [this merge message](https://git.kernel.org/linus/a1257b5e3b7f) has the details.
- The kernel has [gained support for unaccepted memory](https://lwn.net/Articles/928328/) — the protocol by which secure guest systems accept memory allocated by the host. The merged code includes the (somewhat) controversial protocol to automatically accept all provided memory in the firmware when running a guest kernel without support for memory acceptance.
- 支持不可接受内存，
- The BPF subsystem has gained the ability to attach filter functions to [kfuncs](https://lwn.net/Articles/856005/); the filter can limit the contexts from which the kfunc can be invoked. The initial use is to restrict callers of [bpf_sock_destroy()](https://git.kernel.org/linus/4ddbcb886268) to programs of the BPF_TRACE_ITER type.
- Pinning of BPF objects can now be done using O_PATH file descriptors as an alternative to providing the path name for the target directory.

#### Filesystems and block I/O

- It is now possible to mount a filesystem underneath an existing mount on the same mount point; this feature is useful for the provision of seamless updates within containers. See [this article](https://lwn.net/Articles/927491/), [this article](https://lwn.net/Articles/934094/), and [the merge message](https://git.kernel.org/linus/c0a572d9d32f) for details.
- The new cachestat() system call can query the page-cache state of files and directories, allowing user space to determine which of its file pages are currently in RAM. See [this article](https://lwn.net/Articles/917096/) for details and [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/cf264e1329fb) for a man page.

#### Hardware support

- **Miscellaneous**: Renesas RZ/V2M clocked serial interfaces.
- **Networking**: Fintek F81604 USB to 2CAN interfaces, Microchip LAN865x Rev.B0 10BASE-T1S Internal PHYs, Realtek RTL8192FU interfaces, Realtek 8723DS SDIO wireless network adapters, Realtek 8851BE PCI wireless network adapters, and MediaTek SoC Ethernet PHYs.
- **Regulator**: TI TPS6287x power regulators, TI TPS6594 power-management chips, Rockchip RK806 power-management chips, and Renesas RAA215300 power-management ICs.

#### Miscellaneous

- The [nolibc library](https://lwn.net/Articles/920158/) has gained stack protector support, a number of architecture-specific improvements, and more.

#### Networking

- The passing of process credentials, as done with the SCM_CREDENTIALS control message, has been enhanced with a new SCM_PIDFD type. As might be expected from the name, this message passes a [pidfd](https://lwn.net/Articles/794707/) rather than a process ID. There is also a new SO_PEERPIDFD option to [getsockopt()](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setsockopt.2.html) that obtains the pidfd of the peer process.

#### Security-related

- The "secretmem" facility, in the form of the [memfd_secret() system call](https://lwn.net/Articles/865256/), is now enabled by default. This change was made after [some research](https://lwn.net/Articles/931406/) determined that secretmem use does not hurt performance as had been thought.

#### Internal kernel changes

- The workqueue subsystem will now automatically detect CPU-intensive work items (defined as running for at least 10ms by default) and mark them. This will prevent such items from blocking the execution of other work items. There is a new configuration debugging option to enable the reporting of CPU-intensive work items detected in this way.
- workqueue子系统自动检测CPU密集型work并标记
- The kernel is now built with the -fstrict-flex-arrays=3 compiler option, adding more warnings around the use of flexible arrays. See [this article](https://lwn.net/Articles/908817/) for more details on this work.
- The new attribute macro __counted_by() can be used to document which field in a structure contains the number of elements stored in a flexible array (in the same structure). The documentation is useful, but it can also eventually be used for bounds checks as well.

The 6.5 merge window can be expected to remain open until July 9. LWN will be back shortly after that with a summary of the changes pulled in the second half; stay tuned.

# The rest of the 6.5 merge window

By **Jonathan Corbet**  
July 10, 2023

Linus Torvalds [released 6.5-rc1](https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/CAHk-=wj8sPDVoWgaceAs1AiwZrHV8mtC3vQNGbeV6-RypJi6aw@mail.gmail.com/) and closed the merge window for this development cycle on July 9. By that point, 11,730 non-merge changesets had been pulled into the mainline for 6.5; over 7,700 of those were pulled after [the first-half merge-window summary](https://lwn.net/Articles/936418/) was written. The second half of the merge window saw a lot of code coming into the mainline and a long list of significant changes.

The most interesting changes pulled in the latter part of the merge window include:

#### Architecture-specific

- The Loongarch architecture has gained support for simultaneous multi-threading (SMT) and building with the Clang compiler.
- RISC-V now supports ACPI and the [Vector extension](https://git.kernel.org/linus/04a4722eeede).

#### Core kernel

- The function-graph tracer can now record and report the return value from functions; [this documentation commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/21c094d3f8a6) describes how to use this feature.

- ftrace的function-graph可以记录和报告函数的返回值，

- The timer-latency tracer can now be controlled and queried from user space; [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/e88ed227f639) contains some relevant documentation.

- "fprobe events" are a new mechanism for tracing function entry and exit that is better supported on more architectures; [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/334e5519c375) has some more information and [this one](https://git.kernel.org/linus/590e7b280415) has a new document.
  
  These events can also be used to easily trace raw tracepoints that lack a trace-event declaration. Raw tracepoints were created to make it harder to get at deeply internal kernel features, thus making it less likely that user space would come to rely on them; fprobe events are now making it easier again.

#### Filesystems and block I/O

- The overlay filesystem has gained support for data-only layers, which is needed for [composefs](https://lwn.net/Articles/933616/) and similar use cases. [This commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/37ebf056d6cf) contains a small documentation update.
- Overlayfs has also been ported to [the new mount API](https://lwn.net/Articles/759499/).
- The F2FS filesystem has a new errors= mount option to control the response to media errors; [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/b62e71be2110) contains some more information.

#### Internal kernel changes

- The [scope-based resource management patches](https://lwn.net/Articles/934679/) have been merged, but there are unlikely to be any uses of this mechanism in the 6.5 release. Torvalds [said](https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/CAHk-=wjsb5gZTvhXofPCQthk48S9_bSGohXKU8x8XDnf7=bROw@mail.gmail.com/):
  
  > However, let's agree to not really use it for 6.5 yet, and consider it all purely infrastructure for the next release, and for testing it all out in linux-next etc.
  > 
  > We should probably also strive to avoid it for bug-fixes that end up going to stable. I'm sure this will all be backported to stable eventually, but I'd at least personally be happier if that started happening only after we actually have some more interaction with this.

- It is common knowledge that Linus Torvalds does not write much code anymore. That doesn't keep him from getting his hands dirty on occasion, though, as the [merging](https://git.kernel.org/linus/9471f1f2f502) of his "expand stack" series shows. The adoption of the [maple tree](https://lwn.net/Articles/845507/) data structure complicated the task of expanding the user-space process stack, breaking the locking (or lack thereof) that had been in use creating the ["StackRot" vulnerability](https://lwn.net/Articles/937377/). So Torvalds dug in, unified much of the architecture-specific page-fault code, and fixed the problem.
  
  One of the cases that the new code does *not* handle is expanding the stack in response to a get_user_pages() call — something that Torvalds does not think should ever happen. There is [a warning in place](https://git.kernel.org/linus/a425ac5365f6) for the rest of the development cycle to sound the alarm if that assumption turns out to be wrong.

- The 32-bit devicetree files [have been massively reorganized](https://git.kernel.org/linus/6c1561fb9005) to more closely match the 64-bit files. "The impact of this will be that all external patches no longer apply, and anything depending on the location of the dtb files in the build directory will have to change."

- Following the [LSFMM+BPF discussion](https://lwn.net/Articles/932201/), the SLAB allocator has been deprecated and will, barring problems, be removed in a future development cycle.

- The new SLAB_NO_MERGE flag will prevent the slab allocators from merging a cache with (otherwise) compatible caches.

- There were 371 exported symbols added during this merge window and 94 removed; see [this page](https://lwn.net/Articles/937625/) for a full list. Two kfuncs (bpf_cpumask_any() and bpf_cpumask_any_and()) were removed, and five (bpf_cpumask_any_and_distribute(), bpf_cpumask_any_distribute(), bpf_cpumask_first_and(), bpf_sock_destroy(), and bpf_task_under_cgroup()) were added.

The most significant change that was *not* merged was bcachefs, despite its author having sent [a pull request](https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/20230626214656.hcp4puionmtoloat@moria.home.lan/) at the beginning of the merge window. The resulting thread showed that, while quite a few developers seem to want this code merged into the mainline, there are still a number of outstanding issues that need to be addressed and, to put it gently, a certain amount of tension with much of the development community. There is a reasonable chance that all of this will be worked out in time for 6.6, but it may be a noisy process.

Meanwhile, the next seven or eight weeks will be dedicated to the stabilization of all of this new code, with the final 6.5 release expected on either August 27 or September 3.
