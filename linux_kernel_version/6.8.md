# The first half of the 6.8 merge window

By **Jonathan Corbet**  
January 12, 2024

The 6.8 merge window has gotten off to a relatively slow start; reasons for that include a significant scheduler performance regression that Linus Torvalds [stumbled into](https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/CAHk-=wgWcYX2oXKtgvNN2LLDXP7kXkbo-xTfumEjmPbjSer2RQ@mail.gmail.com/) and has spent time tracking down. Even so, 4,282 non-merge changesets have found their way into the mainline repository for the 6.8 release as of this writing. These commits have brought a number of significant changes and new features.

Some of the more interesting changes merged so far include:

#### Core kernel

- The [deadline servers](https://lwn.net/Articles/934415/) mechanism has been added as a way to prevent the starvation of normal tasks when realtime tasks are using all available CPU time.

- 加入deadline servers机制，防止实时进程占用所有CPU时间而普通进程饿死

- The [zswap](https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/mm/zswap.html) subsystem has gained the ability to force cold pages out to (real) swap when memory gets tight. [This commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/b5ba474f3f51) includes some documentation on how to opt into or out of this feature.
  
  There is also a new zswap mode that disables writing back to swap entirely; see [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/501a06fe8e4c) for details.
  
  内存紧张时zswap允许强制将冷页写入swap分区，这个特性可关闭

- The [DAMON](https://docs.kernel.org/mm/damon/index.html) memory-management facility now supports an auto-tuning mechanism; see [this changelog](https://git.kernel.org/linus/9294a037c015) for more information.

- DAMON :Data access monitor。是Linux kernel新提供的内存访问监控框架，支持自动调整机制

- The new TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE_NEVER configuration option causes the use of transparent huge pages to be disabled by default.

- TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE_NEVER配置禁用透明大页机制

- Transparent huge pages can now [be allocated in multiple sizes](https://lwn.net/Articles/937239/) below the normal huge-page size. See [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/3485b88390b0) for some documentation on how to control this feature.

- 透明大页可被分解为多种大小的小页（4K，16K等）

- The new UFFDIO_MOVE operation for [userfaultfd()](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/userfaultfd.2.html) allows pages to be moved within a virtual address space; see [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/adef440691ba) for details.

- UFFDIO_MOVE允许页面在虚拟地址空间内移动

- The "KSM advisor" feature allows for automated tuning of the [kernel samepage merging](https://docs.kernel.org/mm/ksm.html) subsystem; see [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/4e5fa4f5eff6) and [this documentation patch](https://git.kernel.org/linus/0710f38ad26a) for details.

- KSM advisor特性允许自动调整KSM系统

- The BPF verifier has seen a considerable amount of work that should result in successful verification of a wider range of correct programs.

#### Filesystems and block I/O

- The kernel is now able to prevent direct writes to block devices that contain mounted filesystems. This feature, controlled by the BLK_DEV_WRITE_MOUNTED configuration option, is disabled by default but seems likely to be enabled by distributors if it is shown to not break existing workloads. Writes to devices containing mounted Btrfs filesystems remain unrestricted in any case for now, pending the merging of some support patches into that filesystem. (See [this article](https://lwn.net/Articles/941764/) for some background on this change).
- The [listmount() and statmount() system calls](https://lwn.net/Articles/950569/) have been merged; they allow user space to obtain detailed information about mounted filesystems. See [this changelog](https://git.kernel.org/linus/8c9440fea774) for more information.
- The XFS filesystem continues to accumulate changes adding support for the eventual online-repair feature.
- The SMB filesystem has gained the ability to create block and character special files.
- Bcachefs now has a partial (but functional) online filesystem check and repair mechanism.

#### Hardware support

- **Miscellaneous**: DesignWare PCIe performance-monitoring units, Intel IAA compression accelerators, Intel QAT_420xx crypto accelerators, and Lantiq PEF2256 (FALC56) pin controllers.
- **Networking**: Lantiq PEF2256 (FALC56) framers and Texas Instruments DP83TG720 Ethernet 1000Base-T1 PHYs. **Also**: a number of ancient wireless drivers (atmel, hostap, zd1201, orinoco, ray_cs, wl3501, rndis_wlan, and libertas 16-bit PCMCIA) have been removed.

#### Miscellaneous

- Rust support has been added for the creation of network PHY drivers. This work includes [a set of abstractions](https://git.kernel.org/linus/f20fd5449ada) making the driver API available and [a reference driver](https://git.kernel.org/linus/cbe0e4150896) for Asix PHYs. This is the first user-visible Rust code added to the kernel, though it duplicates the functionality of an existing driver and thus does not add new features — yet.

#### Networking

- There has been a fair amount of low-level work to reorganize a number of core networking data structures for better cache efficiency. This may seem like a small change but, as [the networking pull request](https://git.kernel.org/linus/3e7aeb78ab01) noted: "This improves TCP performances with many concurrent connections up to 40%".
- The [bpfilter](https://lwn.net/Articles/822744/) subsystem was meant to be a way of writing firewall rules using BPF; it was first merged for the 4.18 kernel in 2018, but never got to a point where it was usable and has seen little development in recent years. The bpfilter code [has now been removed](https://git.kernel.org/linus/98e20e5e13d2), though development is said to continue in [an external repository](https://github.com/facebook/bpfilter). The associated "usermode blob" mechanism (which was [transformed into "usermode driver"](https://git.kernel.org/linus/e2dc9bf3f527) in 2020) remains in the kernel, though there are no users for it.

#### Security-related

- There are [three new system calls](https://lwn.net/Articles/919059/) — lsm_list_modules(), lsm_get_self_attr(), and lsm_set_self_attr() - for working with Linux security modules. See [Documentation/userspace-api/lsm.rst](https://docs.kernel.org/next/userspace-api/lsm.html) for details.
- The [BPF token mechanism](https://lwn.net/Articles/947173/), which allows fine-grained delegation of BPF-related permissions, was initially merged into the networking tree for inclusion in 6.8. That code ran into trouble, though, when Torvalds realized that it was still treating file descriptor zero as being special; suffice to say [he was not pleased](https://lwn.net/ml/bpf/CAHk-=wg7JuFYwGy=GOMbRCtOL+jwSQsdUaBsRWkDVYbxipbM5A@mail.gmail.com/). So this code was reverted for repairs; discussions are still underway and it will not be ready for this kernel release.

#### Internal kernel changes

- The [scope-based resource management](https://lwn.net/Articles/934679/) mechanism feature has gained some new guards for conditional locks (as obtained with mutex_trylock() and the like). See [this commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/e4ab322fbaaa) for a bit more information.
- As expected, the venerable SLAB memory allocator has been removed, leaving SLUB as the only object-level allocator in the kernel. According to [the merge message](https://git.kernel.org/linus/d30e51aa7b1f): "Removing the choice of allocators has already allowed to simplify and optimize the code wiring up the kmalloc APIs to the SLUB implementation".
- 删除slab分配器，只留下SLUB
- The MAX_ORDER macro is no more; see [this article](https://lwn.net/Articles/956321/) for the whole story.
- The kernel now builds with -Wmissing-prototypes (which generates warnings for calls to functions that have not had a prototype declared for them) on all architectures.

The 6.8 merge window can be expected to remain open through January 21. Tune back in once it has closed for a summary of the remaining changes merged for the next kernel release.

# The rest of the 6.8 merge window

By **Jonathan Corbet**  
January 22, 2024

Linus Torvalds was able to release [6.8-rc1](https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/CAHk-=wiB4iHTtfZKiy5pC24uOjun4fbj4kSX0=ZnGsOXadMf6g@mail.gmail.com/) and close the 6.8 merge window on time despite losing power to his home for most of a week. He noted that this merge window is "maybe a bit smaller than usual", but 12,239 non-merge changesets found their way into the mainline, so it's not *that* small. About 8,000 of those changes were merged since [the first-half summary](https://lwn.net/Articles/957188/) was written; the second half saw a lot of device-driver updates, but there were other interesting changes as well.

Some of the most significant changes pulled in the latter half of the 6.8 merge window are:

#### Architecture-specific

- The riscv architecture has made [more information about supported ISA extensions](https://git.kernel.org/linus/f352a28cc2fb) on the current system available via the riscv_hwprobe() system call. See [Documentation/arch/riscv/hwprobe.rst](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/next/arch/riscv/hwprobe.html) for details on what is available.
- Riscv can also now suspend to RAM if the SUSP SBI extension is present.
- Host-side support for [Intel Trust Domain Extensions (TDX)](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/trust-domain-extensions/overview.html) has been merged; this will eventually allow KVM to create TDX-protected guests. [This documentation commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/4e1c7dddc717) has some more information.
- The LoongArch architecture has added support for modules written in Rust. This architecture has also raised the minimum version of Clang that can be used to 18.0.0 — which has not been released yet.

#### Core kernel

- It is now possible to change the size of tracing sub-buffers used for the reporting of trace events to user space; see [this documentation commit](https://git.kernel.org/linus/7c3f48026589) for more information.
- One new "feature" — the scheduler performance regression encountered by Torvalds early in the merge window — has been removed with [this fix](https://git.kernel.org/linus/e37617c8e53a).

#### Filesystems and block I/O

- The ~~device-mapper~~ multi-device MD_LINEAR, MD_MULTIPATH, and MD_FAULTY targets have been [deprecated](https://git.kernel.org/linus/608f52e30aae) since the 5.14 release in 2021; they have now been removed.

- **Graphics**: Imagination Technologies PowerVR (Series 6 and later) and IMG GPUs, Synaptics R63353-based panels, and Ilitek ILI9805-based panels. **Also merged** is the Intel "Xe" driver for GPUs starting with the Tiger Lake generation. It is not enabled by default anywhere but that will change in some future kernel development cycle.
- **Hardware monitoring**: Monolithic Power Systems MP5990 hot-swap controllers, Monolithic Power Systems mp2856/mp2857 modulation controllers, Analog Devices LTC4286 and LTC4287 hot-swap controllers, and Gigabyte Waterforce X240/X280/X360 AIO CPU coolers.

- **Sound**: Qualcomm X1E80100 audio subsystems and Qualcomm WCD939x USBSS analog audio switches.

#### Miscellaneous

- The perf tool has gained support for [data-type profiling](https://lwn.net/Articles/955709/). Some more details, along with information on a the usual large pile of other perf changes, can be found in [this merge message](https://git.kernel.org/linus/9d64bf433c53).

#### Security-related

- See [this blog post](https://paul-moore.com/blog/d/2024/01/linux_v68_merge_window.html) from Paul Moore covering changes to the kernel's security subsystem in detail.
- The AppArmor security module has switched its policy-hash verification from the SHA-1 hash to SHA-256.
- The task of [removing the strlcpy() API](https://lwn.net/Articles/905777/) from the kernel is now complete.

#### Virtualization and containers

- The [guest-first memory feature](https://lwn.net/Articles/949277/) for KVM has been merged. Guest-first memory can be allocated for and mapped into KVM guests, but is inaccessible to the host, making it suited to confidential-computing applications. There is also a new ioctl() call where the expected attributes for guest memory (including a lack of mapping in the host) can be specified. [This changelog](https://git.kernel.org/linus/6c370dc65374) has some more information.
- KVM on arm64 systems has gained support for 52-bit (LPA2) physical addresses.
- KVM on x86 can now be built without Hyper-V emulation support, reducing the size of the resulting kernel.

#### Internal kernel changes

- The kernel now has [a .editorconfig file](https://git.kernel.org/linus/5a602de99797) that will automatically configure editors to the kernel's coding style.
- The new check-uapi.sh script can be used to detect inadvertent changes to the kernel's user-space API. See [Documentation/dev-tools/checkuapi.rst](https://docs.kernel.org/next/dev-tools/checkuapi.html) for details.

If all goes according to plan (which it pretty much always does), the 6.8 kernel will be released on March 10 or 17. Between now and then, though, there will certainly be a lot of bugs to find and fix.
